<h3>Shark Attacks</h3>
<p> Shark attacks happen frequently in the US and are not to be taken lightly. People do not give these powerful, deadly predators enough respect. These are powerful creatures in the animal kingdom and here is how to survive if you are attacked.
To start, do not swim near a river mouth, this could be a deadly idea. Avoid estuaries where there are lots of bull sharks, great white sharks, and tiger sharks; these are the most likely to attack humans. Avoid swimming near popular fishing spots as well. Equally important, do not swim at night or in the morning, this is when a shark attack is most likely. Do not pee or bleed in the water, sharks can smell this from miles away
If you are attacked by one of these powerful beasts, do not panic. Maintain eye contact with the shark, this will reduce the chance of you being ambushed, the sharkâ€™s signature move. The next part is tricky, but basically you have to just read the situation. If the shark appears t be in attack mode, get big and look as tough as possible so the shark respects you. If it looks like the shark is just passing by, roll into a ball and get small. 
Cut off all angles so the shark is in front of you the entire time. Do not play dead, this is not a bear. Beat the shark if you can, punch, kick, scream, anything to defend yourself. Finally, the exit process. If you make it out of the encounter, slowly back away
</p> 
<h3>Respect the Shark</h3>
<p> The shark is a beautiful gift of life and is a species that should be celebrated and preserved. But do not be fooled, sharks are going to survive and they have been specializing in that field for a long time. The shark views you as a potential threat, so proceed with extreme caution around it at all times. The less encounters we can avoid each year, the better we can learn to coexist with the shark population.
